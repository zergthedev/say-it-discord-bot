# SayIt! Discord bot
SayIt! is a bot for everyone who wants to say ANYTHING in embed.




## Why everyone can send messages in channels where they dont have permissions to chat?
You should delete the 'Administrator' permission. It will send messages in every channel the bot has permission to. But that can do a crash.
## Would there be an required permission to send messages trought the bot?
Yes, I will do it in the future. I have no problem with that.
## What permission will it be?
MANAGE_CHANNELS will be the permission.
## Is there an support server?
YES! It is! Come join in! Click [HERE!](https://discord.gg/ppUVDYTp58)
